With the development of next-generation sequencing, the data has being larger and larger (normal NGS data is normally several gigabytes or terabytes)so that it will be downloaded for a long time. However, there is a software called **Filezilla** that could help you facilitate your downloading processes and save your time.  

### Use Filezilla to download RNA-seq data with multi-threads
After installing Filezilla via Ubuntu Software Center ( you can find in your PC and it is a defualt
software on ubuntu ), you could use it to basically follow this proceduce:

- Open a ```Filezilla``` 
- Open the ```Site Manager``` 
- Copy the Databases Web Site in the ```Host:``` Box 
- Click on ```Connect``` 
- Find the Position of the Files According to ```ftp``` Addresses 
- Download These Files

> Note: In the first 6 weeks, I was working on the paper: `Systematic identification of long noncoding RNAs expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis`. So all my works in this period just focused on the data and methodology given by this paper. Thus, I will show the details of each approaches based on this paper.

### Step 1: Find the Data on This Paper
Generally, the databases the authors used would be posted on the paper in Methods. So I found the
data web site from ```Data access``` below.

And click on ```GSE3289 (RNA-seq)``` , you will find

At the bottom, click ```(ftp)``` and you will see

### Step 2: Download SRA Files via Filezilla

Following the procedure of downloading files via **Filezilla**, you just copy the ```ftp``` site to the ```Host```
(```ftp``` site in this paper: ```ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov```)and click on connect.

And you would find all **SRA** files you want following the sub directories and click it to download by **Filezilla**.

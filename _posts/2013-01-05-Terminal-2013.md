I wrote this blog today due to an issue I met yesterday. Yesterday when I open my terminal and type some command lines to install a new bioinformatics softwares. I always need to switch between my bash window and instruction website again and again. my lazy told me I cannot do it continuously next day, so I want to change my terminal background from solid to transparent. However, after I change the configuration of my terminal background on my PC. it does work as I thought before. It only showed my desktop background and everything between my terminal and desktop background cannot see or maybe the desktop background cover everything under my terminal. Thus, I need to solve this new problem again. If you met a samiliar problem as me, you could see the following procedures I have done below.

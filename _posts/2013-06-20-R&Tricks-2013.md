## Need A Help

Before you get started writing R code, the most important thing to know is how to get help. There are lots of ways to do this. 

### function
{% highlight r %}
> ?mean                  #opens the help page for the mean function  
> ?"+"                   #opens the help page for addition  
> ?"if"                  #opens the help page for if, used for branching code   
{% endhighlight %}

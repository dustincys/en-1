## Need A Help

Before you get started writing R code, the most important thing to know is how to get help. There are lots of ways to do this. 

### function
If you try to figure out how to use a function in R and you have know the its name, you could find out in this way:  
{% highlight r %}
>?mean                  #opens the help page for the mean function  
>?"+"                   #opens the help page for addition  
>?"if"                  #opens the help page for if, used for branching code   
{% endhighlight %}  
The alternative way you could fulfill the same propose is below:  
{% highlight r %}
>help("mean")  
>help("+")   
>help("if")  
{% endhighlight %}

### Keywords
If you don't really know what the function's name, but you could guess out the keywords from it or have already know the parts of its name, you could type two question marks (??) followed by a keyword related to the problem to search. For example:  

{% highlight r %}
>??plotting             #searches for topics containing words like "plotting"
>??"regression model"   #searches for topics containing phrases like this
{% endhighlight %}  

The alternative way you could fulfill the same propose is below:

{% highlight r %}
>help.search("plotting")          #searches for topics containing words like "plotting"
>help.search("regression model")  #searches for topics containing phrases like this
{% endhighlight %}  

> Special characters, reserved words, and multiword search terms need enclosing
in double or single quotes. 

### apropos function  

```apropos``` finds variables (including functions) that match its input. This is really useful if you can only half-remember the name of a variable that youâ€™ve created, or a function that you want to use. For example, suppose you create a variable ```a_vector```:
{% highlight r %}
a_vector <- c(1, 3, 6, 10)
{% endhighlight %}  
You can then recall this variable using apropos:   
{% highlight r %}
apropos("vector")   
## [1] ".__C__vector"         "a_vector"             "as.data.frame.vector"   
## [4] "as.vector"            "as.vector.factor"     "is.vector"   
## [7] "vector"               "Vectorize"  
{% endhighlight %}  
The results contain the variable you just created, ```a_vector```, and all other variables that
contain the string vector. In this case, all the others are functions that are built into R.   
Just finding variables that contain a particular string is fine, but you can also do fancier matching with apropos using regular expressions.   
A simple usage of apropos could, for example, find all variables that end in z, or to find
all variables containing a number between 4 and 9:   
{% highlight r %}
apropos("z$")   
## [1] "alpe_d_huez" "alpe_d_huez" "force_tz"    "indexTZ"     "SSgompertz"   
## [6] "toeplitz"    "tz"          "unz"         "with_tz"   
{% endhighlight %}  

{% highlight r %}
apropos("[4-9]")   
##  [1] ".__C__S4"            ".__T__xmlToS4:XML"   ".parseISO8601"   
##  [4] ".SQL92Keywords"      ".TAOCP1997init"      "asS4"   
##  [7] "assert_is_64_bit_os" "assert_is_S4"        "base64"   
## [10] "base64Decode"        "base64Encode"        "blues9"   
## [13] "car90"               "enc2utf8"            "fixPre1.8"   
## [16] "Harman74.cor"        "intToUtf8"           "is_64_bit_os"   
## [19] "is_S4"               "isS4"                "seemsS4Object"   
## [22] "state.x77"           "to.minutes15"        "to.minutes5"   
## [25] "utf8ToInt"           "xmlToS4"   
{% endhighlight %}

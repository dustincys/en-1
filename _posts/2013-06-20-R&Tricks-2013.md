## Need A Help

Before you get started writing R code, the most important thing to know is how to get help. There are lots of ways to do this. 

### function
If you try to figure out how to use a function in R and you have know the its name, you could find out in this way:  
{% highlight r %}
>?mean                  #opens the help page for the mean function  
>?"+"                   #opens the help page for addition  
>?"if"                  #opens the help page for if, used for branching code   
{% endhighlight %}  
The alternative way you could fulfill the same propose is below:  
{% highlight r %}
>help("mean")  
>help("+")   
>help("if")  
{% endhighlight %}

### Keywords
If you don't really know what the function's name, but you could guess out the keywords from it or have already know the parts of its name, you could type two question marks (??) followed by a keyword related to the problem to search. For example:  

{% highlight r %}
>??plotting             #searches for topics containing words like "plotting"
>??"regression model"   #searches for topics containing phrases like this
{% endhighlight %}  

The alternative way you could fulfill the same propose is below:

{% highlight r %}
>help.search("plotting")          #searches for topics containing words like "plotting"
>help.search("regression model")  #searches for topics containing phrases like this
{% endhighlight %}  

> Special characters, reserved words, and multiword search terms need enclosing
in double or single quotes.

title: The Glossary of Bioinformatics And Molecular Biology

tags: [bioinformatics, basic knowledge, molecular biology]

Recently I have spent my extracurricular time reviewing the basic knowledge of bioinformatics, molecular biology and cell biologyThese glossary of bioinformatics and molecular biology that I have dropped for a long time. This process always drived me crazy and today I finally cannot stand for it. So I just built a specific page for all the glossary I often used at my work to avoid looking them up the reference books or searching them online frequently. The glossary I collected is almost from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).

## [Bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics):

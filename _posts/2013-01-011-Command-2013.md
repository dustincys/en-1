Before I installed the dual-boot (Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7) on my PC, I always use **R** to handle with the datasets.
However, Due to the lower speed of **R**, I start using Linux Command lines to treat these, like using ```grep```, ```awk```,
 ```sed```, ```cat``` and etc to precess text files, which is much better than using **R**, espectially at the part of speed.
Now command lines have been an essential tools for my daily work. I cannot leave these for processing data. Today I will
show some very useful command lines at my real job.

## What is SRA and FASTQ format?
- [SRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Read_Archive)(Sequence Read Archive): The Sequence Read Archive originally Short Read Archive is a
bioinformatics database that provides a public repository for DNA sequencing data, especially the
"short reads" generated by High-throughput sequencing, which are typically less than 1000 base
pairs in length.
- [FASTQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastq) format: is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide
sequence) and its corresponding quality scores.

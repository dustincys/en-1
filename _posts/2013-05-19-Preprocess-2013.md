## The Workflow of Pre-processing And Controlling the Raw NGS Data:  
- Step 1: Download the SRA files And Install Related Software 
- Step 2: Convert SRA Format to FASTQ Format 
- Step 3: Filter the Lower Quality Data

## What is SRA and FASTQ format?
- [SRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Read_Archive)(Sequence Read Archive): The Sequence Read Archive originally Short Read Archive is a
bioinformatics database that provides a public repository for DNA sequencing data, especially the
"short reads" generated by High-throughput sequencing, which are typically less than 1000 base
pairs in length.
- [FASTQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastq) format: is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores.

Based on the first paper ([Systematic identification of long noncoding RNAs expressed during zebrafish embryogenesis](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3290793/)) I worked, the RNA-seq and Chip-seq data are both SRA formats. Because SAR format data cannot be used directly, before analysing these data in next step, I should
convert that into FASTQ format.

## Download the SRA files And Install Related Softwares 
The steps of downloading SRA files you could reference the journal I wrote before: [The Fast Download with FileZilla (Ubuntu)](http://lushen.github.com/en/2013/05/FileZilla-2013/). After preparing all the SRAfiles, nextstepis that installing specific softwares to process data and then improve the quality of your data. I choose the SRAtoolkit and FASTXtoolkit to do that, which could help you to pre-process your files and filter the data with a low quality respectively.

## Convert SRA Format to FASTQ Format  

- Currently, there are countless softwares that could be used to convert SRA to FASTQ format, here I just used **SRA toolkit**.
Here list the procedure to download it(eg. CentOS Linux 64 bit architecture ):  
```
$ wget "http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz"  
$ tar xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz  
```
- Open the file that have untarred and find ' fastq-dump' in it.  
```
$ cd sratoolkit.2.3.2-5-centos_linux64/bin/  
$ ls  
```

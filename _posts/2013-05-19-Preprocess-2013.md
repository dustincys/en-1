## The Workflow of Pre-processing And Controlling the Raw NGS Data:  
- Step 1: Download the SRA files And Install Related Software 
- Step 2: Convert SRA Format to FASTQ Format 
- Step 3: Filter the Lower Quality Data

## What is SRA and FASTQ format?
- [SRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Read_Archive)(Sequence Read Archive): The Sequence Read Archive originally Short Read Archive is a
bioinformatics database that provides a public repository for DNA sequencing data, especially the
"short reads" generated by High-throughput sequencing, which are typically less than 1000 base
pairs in length.
- [FASTQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastq) format: is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide
sequence) and its corresponding quality scores.

## Download the SRA files And Install Related Software 
The steps of downloading SRA files you could reference the journal I wrote before: [The Fast Download with FileZilla (Ubuntu)](http://lushen.github.com/en/2013/05/FileZilla-2013/)

## The Workflow of Dumping Excel or Text File Format into Databases with Perl
- Step1: Check all the available databases on your PC   
- Step2: Programming with **Perl** (Change the format with **Regex** and dump into databases with **DBI**)
- Step4: Simplify your code and make it reusable   

### Step1: Check all the available databases on your PC

{% highlight perl %}#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;
my @drivers = DBI->available_drivers;
print join( ", ", @drivers ), "\n";
{% endhighlight %}

After you run it on your **eclipse**, you could see the result like below

```   
DBM, ExampleP, File, Gofer, Pg, Proxy, SQLite, Sponge, mysql   
```   
> Note: If some database drivers are not available on your PC, like sqlite. you could add these manually as following 

Add **sqlite3** driver to the available_dirivers   

```  
$ sudo perl -MCAPN -e shell   
cpan> install DBI   
cpan[2]> install DBD::SQLite  
```

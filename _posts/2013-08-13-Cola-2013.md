Cola Git GUI is a highly caffeinated git GUI, which make **pull** repositories from github and **push** files and directories to github. And now I will introduce how to use it simply.

### Download Git from [Git](http://git-scm.com/download) Homepage and Install **Cola Git GUI** from **Ubuntu Software Center**

It is easiest to install Git on Linux using the preferred package manager of your Linux distribution.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
### Configure the GIT on Your PC

After you have installed on your PC, you should set the user's **name** and **email** as same as those on your [github](https://github.com).

And you could find **Cola Git GUI** from **Applications** -> **Programming** and open it. And you could see below.

### Clone the Repositories You Want to Add or Delete Files from Your Github

#### 1. Open your github page where the repository you want to be cloned

I just randomly selected one repository named **Beginning-Perl-for-Bioinfomatics** from my github that displayed below.

Usually, you should set branch as **master** and type the user name and user's email into the dialogs. After that, this directory could be pushed online.

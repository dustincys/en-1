Cola Git GUI is a highly caffeinated git GUI, which make **pull** repositories from github and **push** files and directories to github. And now I will introduce how to use it simply.

### Download Git from [Git](http://git-scm.com/download) Homepage and Install **Cola Git GUI** from **Ubuntu Software Center**

It is easiest to install Git on Linux using the preferred package manager of your Linux distribution.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
### Configure the GIT on Your PC

After you have installed on your PC, you should set the user's **name** and **email** as same as those on your [github](https://github.com).

### Clone the Repositories You Want to Add or Delete Files from Your Github

#### 4. Add the files into or delete them from the local directory cloned from your github

Here, I make a case that I create a new text file named "Change.txt" at this cloned directory and at the same time, there are some changes in the **Cola GUI** dialog.

Select all the changed tracks in this dialog and click the **Stage** button.

#### 5. Stage the changed files at the local directory and commit a massege

After these, you should commit a massege from these staged files for preparing the submittion at next step.

You could write anything you want, just make sure that it will be easy to understand what you submitted this time.(Because it will help you modified in the later)

After pressing **commit** button, then you click **push** at the right side. (shortcut displayed below)

#### 6. Push this directory to your github 

Usually, you should set branch as **master** and type the user name and user's email into the dialogs. After that, this directory could be pushed online.

After clicking **push**, you could see a new window showed up and type your in your**username** and **password** as same as your github that you registed before. After these just click **OK**.

If you see something like below, that means you have pushed your changes back to your original repository. Laterly, you could see these at your github.

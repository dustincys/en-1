As more and more RNA-seq, Chip-seq, and others data are generated in the recent years, it is
difficult to search, find and insert the information in your file with traditional approaches. For
example, if the size of your files are more than 200 MB or the lines in the file is over 100 thousand,
it is not easy to open, let alone to operate it. In this case, we should convert your original files into
tables with logic structures and dump them in your SQL databases by Perl or Shell scripts. The
original information is easily handled via SQL commands with quicker speed. For this week and
following one week, I would concentrate on these parts.

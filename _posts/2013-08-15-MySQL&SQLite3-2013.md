As more and more **RNA-seq**, **Chip-seq**, and others data are generated in the recent years, it is
difficult to search, find and insert the information in your file with traditional approaches. For
example, if the size of your files are more than 200 MB or the lines in the file is over 100 thousand,
it is not easy to open, let alone to operate it. In this case, we should convert your original files into
tables with logic structures and dump them in your SQL databases by Perl or Shell scripts. The
original information is easily handled via SQL commands with quicker speed. For this week and
following one week, I would concentrate on these parts.

## Background Complement
- [**MySQL**](http://www.mysql.com/): The world's second most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language
- [**SQLite**](https://sqlite.org/): SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.

> Compared with MySQL, sqlite, a light database, is more convenient because it could be transfered to flash driver and carried it to anywhere. However, due to its limited space(approximate 2TB), it cannot hold a large dataset, so sometimes it still should be transfered to MySQL.

## The Workflow of Dumping the Data from Sqlite3 to MySQL with Java 
- Step1: Find out the difference of the format between **MySQL** and **sqlite3**   
- Step2: Dump Out the data from sqlite3
- Step3: Programming with **Java** (Change the format with **Regex** and dump into databases with **JDBC**)   
- Step4: Simplify your code and make it reusable   

### Step1: Find out the difference of the format between **MySQL** and **sqlite3**

What is the difference of the schema file between Sqlite3 and MySQL. For example, if you want to convert the format from Sqlite3 to MySQL, you should change some settings in SQLite.   
>1. Strip out “ PRAGMA ” lines   
2. Strip out “ BEGIN TRANSACTION; ” lines   
3. Strip out “ COMMIT; ”lines   
4. Strip out “ DELETE FROM ” and “ INSERT INTO ” and the sqlite_sequence table   
5. Replace “ AUTOINCREMENT ” with “ AUTO_INCREMENT ”    
6. Replace DEFAULT 't' and DEFAULT 'f' with DEFAULT '1' and DEFAULT '0'   
7. Replace ,'t' and ,'f' with ,'1' and ,'0'   
8. Replace " with ` except in string values (otherwise it replaces all quotes in your text)   

### Step2: Dump Out the data from sqlite3   

#### Backup your databases   
Backup MySQL Databases: ```mysqldump -u username -p password databases > output.sql(.txt)```   
{% highlight sh %}$ mysqldump -uroot -plushen821999 zebrafish > zebrafish.txt(.sql){% endhighlight %}   
Even you could dump into a zip file   
{% highlight sh %}$ mysqldump -uroot -plushen821999 zebrafish | gzip > zebrafish.sql.gz{% endhighlight %}   
> If you want to recover the databases in MySQL, first you should have dumped the databases' files and create the databases name that you want to recovered with `mysql> create database zebrafish`. Next use the command line below to restore your dumped files: `mysqldump -uroot -plushen821999 zebrafish < zebrafish.sql`.   

Backup SQLite3 Databases: ```sqlite3 databases.db ".dump" > schema.sql(.txt)```   
{% highlight sh %}$ sqlite3 TrinityFunctional.db ".dump" > TrinityFunctional.txt(.sql){% endhighlight %}   
>This week, I treated a .sql file named “ TrinityFunctional.sql ” dumped from sqlite3 as below.
```
$ sqlite3 TrinityFunctional.db
```
. After entering your sqlite3, you should dump your tables you need from your it.
```
sqlite> .dump
```

After that, you could find a file named “ TrinityFunctional.sql ” at your current directory, which
stored all the SQL information of your tables and the contents of this files is showed below.

However, if you want just dump out the schema of the databases, you could dump with the command line below  
{% highlight sh %}$ sqlite3 TrinityFunctional.db ".shema" > TrinityFunctional.txt(.sql){% endhighlight %}   
### Step3: Programming with **Java** (Change the format with **Regex** and dump into databases with **JDBC**)

As more and more RNA-seq, Chip-seq, and others data are generated in the recent years, it is
difficult to search, find and insert the information in your file with traditional approaches. For
example, if the size of your files are more than 200 MB or the lines in the file is over 100 thousand,
it is not easy to open, let alone to operate it. In this case, we should convert your original files into
tables with logic structures and dump them in your SQL databases by Perl or Shell scripts. The
original information is easily handled via SQL commands with quicker speed. For this week and
following one week, I would concentrate on these parts.

The Workflow of Dumping the Data from Sqlite3 to MySQL with Perl   
- Step1: Check all the available databases on your PC   
- Step2: Find out the difference of the format between MySQL and sqlite3   
- Step3: Programming with Perl (Change the format with Regex)   
- Step4: Simplify your code and make it reusable   

Step1: Check all the available databases on your PC

{% highlight perl %}

#!/usr/bin/perl

use strict;
use warnings;
use DBI;
my @drivers = DBI->available_drivers;
print join( ", ", @drivers ), "\n";

{% endhighlight %}

After you run it on your **eclipse**, you could see the result like below

```   
DBM, ExampleP, File, Gofer, Pg, Proxy, SQLite, Sponge, mysql   
```   
> Note: If some database drivers are not available on your PC, like sqlite. you could add these manually as following 

Add SQLite3 driver to the available_dirivers   
```  
$ sudo perl -MCAPN -e shell   
cpan> install DBI   
cpan[2]> install DBD::SQLite  
```

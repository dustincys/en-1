**JBrowse** is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with **JavaScript** and **HTML5**, with optional run-once data formatting tools written in **Perl**. JBrowse is the one of the most popular genome browser that designed for displaying NGS data. **JBrowse** is a genome browser with a fully dynamic **AJAX** interface, being developed as the eventual successor to **GBrowse**. It is very fast and scales well to large datasets. **JBrowse** is javascript-based and does almost all of its work directly in the user's web browser, with minimal requirements for the server.

The Workflow of Setuping JBrowse: Just reference the given totorial: [JBrowse Quick-Start Tutorial](http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.11.3/docs/tutorial/)

{% highlight sh %}# make a directory that this user can write to
sudo mkdir /var/www/jbrowse;
sudo chown `whoami` /var/www/jbrowse;
# cd into it
cd /var/www/jbrowse;
# fetch a JBrowse release zip file
curl -O http://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.11.3.zip
# unzip it and cd into it
unzip JBrowse-1.11.3.zip
cd JBrowse-1.11.3 
./setup.sh {% endhighlight %}

After runing that, you could see your local JBrowse at ```http://your.machine.address/jbrowse/index.html?data=sample_data/json/volvox```   

> Note: `your.machine.address` is your machine address whose default address is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. If you cannot work, maybe there are some problems on your `Apache`. You could resart it by this command: `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`. and it will give you a new default address like `127.0.1.1`. After that you could see your own `JBrowse` at your local web.

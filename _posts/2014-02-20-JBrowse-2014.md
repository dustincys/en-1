**JBrowse** is a fast, embeddable genome browser built completely with **JavaScript** and **HTML5**, with optional run-once data formatting tools written in **Perl**. JBrowse is the one of the most popular genome browser that designed for displaying NGS data. **JBrowse** is a genome browser with a fully dynamic **AJAX** interface, being developed as the eventual successor to **GBrowse**. It is very fast and scales well to large datasets. **JBrowse** is javascript-based and does almost all of its work directly in the user's web browser, with minimal requirements for the server.

## The Workflow of Setuping JBrowse:  
Just reference the given totorial: [JBrowse Quick-Start Tutorial](http://jbrowse.org/code/JBrowse-1.11.3/docs/tutorial/)

```   
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/jbrowse	# make a directory that this user can write to
$ sudo chown `whoami` /var/www/jbrowse
$ cd /var/www/jbrowse	# cd into it
$ curl -O http://jbrowse.org/releases/JBrowse-1.11.3.zip	# fetch a JBrowse release zip file
$ unzip JBrowse-1.11.3.zip 	# unzip it and cd into it
$ cd JBrowse-1.11.3 
$ ./setup.sh	# to get started with a working JBrowse running on example Volvox data  
```

After runing that, you could see your local JBrowse at ```http://your.machine.address/jbrowse/index.html?data=sample_data/json/volvox```   

> Note: `your.machine.address` is your machine address whose default address is `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`. If you cannot work, maybe there are some problems on your `Apache`. You could resart it by this command: `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`. and it will give you a new default address like `127.0.1.1` or the original one (`127.0.0.1` or `localhost`). After that you could see your own `JBrowse` at your local web.

> Note you still could change the name of the default machine.address by `/etc/hosts`. First you should open it with command `sudo vim /etc/hosts` and add a new machine address like `lushen.com` at the end of the first line, then save it and exit.

After that, you could see your **JBrowse** with a new machine address(lushen.com).

From 2012, I started engaging at bioinformatics and programming, so the first problem coming to me is that which is the best IDEs for my programming work and can be used sustainably. So from that time, I have tried a lot of IDEs including the famous ```Vim```and ```Emacs```, but I still cannot get used to programming with them until I find these wouderful IDEs below that were frequently used in my daily work.

## The Wouderful IDEs list:
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): It could apply for almost all kinds of programming languages with convenience
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/): It was designed for compiling Java. However, it also could compile Python, Perl, C/C++, PHP and even R.
- [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/): The best R IDE, it still a good tool to compile Markdown with **knitr** package.

### Sublime Text

**Sublime Text 3** is my favoriate eidtor now. Because you could compile any language on it. If it does not have or run some languages, you could install some plug-ins to solve these issues. If you want to modify any code, you just drag the folders contain these code files. 
The list display the procedures to install essential tools for **Sublime Text 3**

- Install **Package Control** 
- Install **plug-in**s
- Others

The list of plug-ins is necessary for your job(I think!):


### Eclipse

**Eclipse** is developed for **Java** originally. However, now **Eclipse** has been mutil-languages' programming platform. You just add some plug-ins in it and it could compile and run these languages, even throw helpful messages and indent automatically.
For example, the procedures below of installing plug-in of Perl

### Rstudio

**Rstudio** is currently the most profect R editor, which make R programming more convenient.

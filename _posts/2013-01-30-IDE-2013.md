From 2012, I started engaging at bioinformatics and programming, so the first problem coming to me is that which is the best IDEs for my programming work and can be used sustainably. So from that time, I have tried a lot of IDEs including the famous ```Vim```and ```Emacs```, but I still cannot get used to programming with them until I find these wouderful IDEs below that were frequently used in my daily work.

## The Wouderful IDEs list:
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): It could apply for almost all kinds of programming languages with convenience.  
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/): It was designed for compiling Java. However, it also could compile Python, Perl, C/C++, PHP and even R.  
- [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/): The best R IDE, it still a good tool to compile Markdown with **knitr** package.  
## Sublime Text 3

**Sublime Text 3** is my favoriate eidtor now. Because you could compile any language on it. If it does not have or run some languages, you could install some plug-ins to solve these issues. If you want to modify any code, you just drag the folders contain these code files. 
The list display the procedures to install essential tools for **Sublime Text 3**

- Install **Package Control**   
The simplest method of installation is through the Sublime Text console. The console is accessed via the ```ctrl+``` ` shortcut or the *View > Show Console menu*. Once open, paste the appropriate Python code for your version of Sublime Text into the console.   

```    
import urllib.request,os,hashlib; h = '7183a2d3e96f11eeadd761d777e62404e330c659d4bb41d3bdf022e94cab3cd0'; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); by = urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ', '%20')).read(); dh = hashlib.sha256(by).hexdigest(); print('Error validating download (got %s instead of %s), please try manual install' % (dh, h)) if dh != h else open(os.path.join( ipp, pf), 'wb' ).write(by)   
```

After pressing ```Enter``` button and wait for a while, then you could see ```Package Control``` items in its ```Preferences```. And you could freely install packages on your sublime text 3 now.

- Install **plug-in**s
- Others

The list of plug-ins is necessary for your jobs(I think!):


## Eclipse

**Eclipse** is developed for **Java** originally. However, now **Eclipse** has been mutil-languages' programming platform. You just add some plug-ins in it and it could compile and run these languages, even throw helpful messages and indent automatically.
For example, the procedures below of installing EPIC (plug-in of Perl) at **Eclipse** on **Ubuntu**:

Another example is how to set up environment of running C/C++ at **Eclipse** on **Ubuntu**:

Or if you want to run some Perl codes by **Eclipse**, how to set it:

## Rstudio

**Rstudio** is currently the most profect R editor, which make R programming more convenient.

The list of packages is necessary for your jobs(I think!):  
- [knitr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html): A general-purpose package for dynamic report generation in R.  
- [ggplot2](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html): An implementation of the Grammar of Graphics.  
- [Rcpp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html): Seamless R and C++ Integration.  
- [shiny](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/shiny/index.html): Web Application Framework for R

From 2012, I started engaging at bioinformatics and programming, so the first problem coming to me is that which is the best IDEs for my programming work and can be used sustainably. So from that time, I have tried a lot of IDEs including the famous ```Vim```and ```Emacs```, but I still cannot get used to programming with them until I find these wouderful IDEs below that were frequently used in my daily work.

## The Wouderful IDEs list:
- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): It could apply for almost all kinds of programming languages with convenience
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/): It was designed for compiling Java. However, it also could compile Python, Perl, C/C++, PHP and even R.
- [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/): The best R IDE, it still a good tool to compile Markdown with **knitr** package.

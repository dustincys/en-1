Because there are too many tutorials and examples about **ggplot2** online now and someone has summerize its usage prefectly, thus I would not waste too much time on showing that how it works. And I just post the links below.    

The online reference that I always frequented is on this list:

- [ggplot2 index](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/index.html):



So this journal will be a gallery to show some extra examples which were unique or done by myself at my work. For each one, I will give the complete data and codes with comments to help you understand. Ok, that's all.

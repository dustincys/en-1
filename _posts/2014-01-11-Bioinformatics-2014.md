Not finished

The new year has come, I am planing to summerize the experience of learning bioinformatics by myself. So today I write this blog to share my real experience with you. I hope this blog could help you to start your bioinformatics study at the very beginning.

## The Essential Equipments Before Getting Started
### HPC(supercomputer is much better)
- Strategy One: Buy A HPC by Yourself

For my experience, if you want to learning bioinformatics by yourself, A high-performance computer is essential for your work every day. The most of my work at my position is to analyze data with GB or even TB size or programming some script to run it. So my working efficiency really depended on the performance of my computer. Thus, choosing a powerful computer will speed up your work processes in the future. For my choice, I bought a second-hand lenovo computer (Y470) which cost me 500 bucks from my mentor. (the snapshot is below)

- Strategy Two: Find Someone Who Could Offer HPC to YOU

If you cannot afford one HPC by yourself, there is still another alternative approach to fulfill your propose. You could ask someone like your mentor for allowing you to register the supercomputer at lab and use it. For me, I could register an account of TACC and freely use it and I can also use other HPCs at my lab. The supercomupter provided by the labs is much better than you have. Thus, If you have any chances to use these resources at your lab, you don't refuse these.

As we know, Secure Shell ([SSH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)) is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication. The common usage for me is to use it to login a remote computer or HPC. 

## Configure the SSH on your PC

### Usage of SSH

The most common way to login the computer with **SSH** is below.

```
$ ssh stampede.tacc.utexas.edu -l ls2013
```
or

```
$ ssh lushen@stampede.tacc.utexas.edu
```
After typing your password, you can enter the computer and use it. 

### Simplify the Procedure That You Login Remote Computer or HPC 

However, the easier way to enter your supercomputer and avoid typing so tedious username is that

First, open the **.ssh** directory under your local directory.

```
$ cd .ssh
```
Second, open the **config** file in it with [vim](http://www.vim.org/).

```
$ vim config
```
and compile some statements in the config ( after ' # ' are comments)

```
Host=stampede # username that is used to login TACC in your terminal.
Hostname=stampede.tacc.utexas.edu # hostname you registered in your TACC account.
User=lushen # username your registered in your TACC account.
```
After saving that, you can login your supercomputer just use and type in your password, you could enter the remote computer from your PC.

After these procedures, you can just simply type **stampede** to login, like below.

```
$ ssh stampede
```
and just type your password and everything has been done so far.

## Set the Environment Variables

There are three ways to set the environment variables on your Ubuntu. One can set a peramental path and another one just sets a temporary path. 

### Set the Temporary Path

This is the simplest way to modify your path on your PC. However, when you exit from this terminal, the path you modified will cancel and recover back.

### Set the Peramental Path

If you set the path following the steps above, after we shutdown or reset your PC, all the path will disappear. In this case, you have to add these path again, which is very tedious and time-consuming for your works. So how to solve this issue? We could add the permantal pathes on your local directory. I will show the example that how to set a peramental path for **Trinity** in the **.bashrc** file.

#### 1. Use **vim** to open the **.bashrc** file 

```
$ vim .bashrc
```

Note: from the shortcut above, you could see I just add some pathes like followinsgs:

#### 2. Press "i" and you just add the new path at the end of the **.bashrc**:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/shen/temp/trinityrnaseq_r20131110
```
After that, you could see below

#### 3.Press ```ESC``` and type```:wq``` to save the changes

After these procedure, you just exit from this terminal and resart a new one. After that, you could reuse **Trinity** and others without setting their pathes again.

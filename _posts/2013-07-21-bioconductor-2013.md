My original major in China was Biological Science before I transfered to Iowa State University. However, I was deeply attracted by bioinformatics when the first time I touched it at my sophomore year (2012). So after that, I have tried a lots of ways to learn this cutting-edge major. From my perspective, reading the Bioinformatics Books is a good way to start for the beginners. Today I want to list some good books I have read and give some short introduction for each one.

## Programming Books 

As far as I knew, there are a bunch of programming books involving bioinformatics currently. However, if you are the beginner of binoinformatics or this is the first time you do some programming things. These books I will recommend below are very useful.

### *A Beginners' Guide to R*

The first book named *A Beginners' Guide to R*, which is the first book I read that indirectly involving bioinformatics. I read it because I want to draw some diagram or chart for 
the analyzed data. R language is very popular in biology, not only it could draw various kinds of beautiful scientific diagrams for the paper to publish, but also it is easy to do some statistical analysis like. So if you want to find a book to start learning R language, this book is a good choice.

### *Learning Perl*

The second called *Learning Perl*, which is the essential book for every rookie of Perl user. Because Perl has a strong power in treating strings with regular expression. So it is widely used in bioinformatics to accomplish a complicated data analysis. this book is very understandable for every Perl beginners.

## Molecular & Cell Biology Books

Choosing a good molecular or cell Biology book and reviewing all the basic concepts it is necessary for every bioinformatic student. Reading it and sketching out a whole profile of experimental procedure. like I often analyzed the RNA-seq data in my work, so where these data come from? or How these sequencing data generate from a cell or a tissue to "ATGC" String in my text file. Only you are very familiar with these basic knowledge, you can be thought as a qualified bioinformatican. However, someone maybe doubt that because the updating speeding in bioinformatic fields is extremely fast. Catching up with current techniques is very hard today, why should we review the previous knowledge? First, almost experimental methods did not change although some of them have been used for several decades. Even experimental equipments have been more and more advanced with the development of biotechnologies, but basic experimental logic have never been change seriously. In other words, the methods are updating every day, but basic logic is still same.

### *Molecular Biology*

So there are a lot of books about molecular biology and cell biology, you could find one from these which is suitable for your taste. And I chose this book called *Molecular Biology* whose author is Weaver, Robert F.

## Bioinformatics Books

Last but not least, I want to introduce some of bioinformatics books I have read for the beginners. Due to the fast pace of development of bioinformatics, many books have been out of date even before they are going to be published. So for my perspective, some resources from the Internet are more useful than books. However, if you want to build up a whole sketch of development of bioinformatics with the time line, books is the best choice to fulfill this propose. 

### *A Primer of Genome Science*

The first book I want to recommend is that: *A Primer of Genome Science*, which has a lot of picture to help you understand and is not out of date too much. (it was published at 2009). So this book still worth reading currently.

### *Bioinformatics and Functional Genomics*

The second book is a little bit old school but it is still classic if you want to know about the history of bioinformatics development and basic working priciple that was still widely applied in bioinformatics. For example, the algorithm of scoring matrix, how dose BLAST work, FASTA format, how to use NCBI at practice etc. It will really help you to establish a basic profile of bioinformatics development.

###  *Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics*

The last one named *Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics*, which provide a lot of basic examples that how to apply Perl in bioinformatics at practice. If you have done Learning Perl, this book will be super easy for you.

## Usage of Books

### *ggplot2*

This book mainly introduce that how to use a R package called *ggplot2*, which could help you draw some incredible scientific diagrams. By the way, ggplot2 is one of the best R graphic packages.

Some books are for intensive study and some are for cursory reading. Some of them you must read carefully for laying a good foundation of the whole basic knowledge. Some just read depend on your needs or use them as reference books, like Learning Perl, this book could help you sketch out a whole profile for Perl programming, so you need reading it by your heart. However, ggplot2(above), this book you do not have to read sentence by sentence. You just treat it as a reference book and read it when you need at practice. You did not have to waste too much time on it except you are intrested in the source code and want to deeply understand inside.

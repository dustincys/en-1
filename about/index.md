You have known a little bit about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This is a blog site. It is particularly focused on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please do not take everything for granted.
### Acknowledge

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name) by Yihui Xie; the homepage was based on the design of [Tengfei Yin](http://www.tengfei.name) (thanks a lot, guys!).

You have known a little bit about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This is a blog site which shared my learning process about Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please do not take everything for granted. And
If you find any errors existing in my blog, you can freely contact me, Thank you!
### Acknowledge

This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name) by Yihui Xie; the homepage was based on the design of [Tengfei Yin](http://www.tengfei.name) (thanks a lot, guys!).
